# Algorithms
A collection of completed algorithms projects in C++

## Project 1

Write a mergesort function which makes three recursive calls of length n/3 on an array of size n, and then merges three sorted arrays into one:
void mergesort(int * a, int * aux, int length);

## Project 2


## Project 3

Write a function that finds the shortest path through a maze, from start point s to target t, using Breadth First Search. The function declaration is:
void BFS(int n, int * maze);
Here n is the sidelength of the maze, ∗maze is an n ×n array representing the maze, with entry 0 representing a blocked point, entry 1 representing an open point, and entries 2 and 3 representing the start and target points. Your function sets all the entries for fields on the shortest path to 4.
